# Caesar Cipher GUI Tool

A simple Python application that provides a graphical interface to encrypt and decrypt text files using the Caesar Cipher algorithm.

## Features

- Encrypts and decrypts text using Caesar Cipher.
- File-based encryption and decryption.
- Easy-to-use GUI built with Tkinter.

## How It Works

- The Caesar Cipher shifts each letter in the text by a specified number of positions.
- You can choose to **encrypt** or **decrypt** a file by providing the shift value.
- Non-alphabetic characters are preserved as-is.

## Getting Started

1. Make sure you have Python installed (Python 3.6+ recommended).
2. Clone this repository.
3. Ensure `gui_components.py` and `gui_constants.py` are in the same directory as `main.py`.
4. Run the application:

```bash
python main.py
